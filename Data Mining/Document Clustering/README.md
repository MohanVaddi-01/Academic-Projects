Developed a clustering system using K-Means clustering algorithm in order to cluster 16000 job records into different clusters. The system also computed TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for determining similarity between jobs. The clustering engine had an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.567.

Technologies: K-Means Algorithm, Python, Python NLTK
